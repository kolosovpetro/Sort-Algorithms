# Sort Algorithms

Implementation of Sort Algorithms as follows:

- Bubble Sort
- Cocktail Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Selection Sort

Benchmarks of algorithms are measured. 

## How to choose right sort algorithm?

- Choose insertion sort if the input is small, or elements are roughly sorted, or you need very simple code
- Choose heapsort if worst-case scenario is your main concern
- Choose quicksort in general case
